              <h2>Welcome to My Developer's Diary</h2>
              <p>Thrilled to have you here! I'm excited to share my journey of developing DuskRealm, a game that's captured my imagination and passion. This diary will provide you with insights into my process - the thoughts, the hurdles, and the victories that accompany a game developer's life.</p>
              <p>This space is not just a progress tracker; it's a place to reflect, share lessons learned, articulate future plans, and interact with the gaming community. I believe that transparency in development cultivates a stronger bond with potential players and invites invaluable insights. So, let's embark on this journey together and bring DuskRealm to life!</p>

              <h2>June 15th, 2023</h2>
              <p>Yesterday evening, I re-engaged with the development of DuskRealm. After a several-months hiatus, restarting the game felt like a heartwarming reunion, yet one accompanied by the realization of an enormous task ahead.</p>
              <p>Upon revisiting the initial version, I noticed a significant misstep: the baked-in game <span class="highlight">platforms</span>. Our map, created in Paint.NET, was directly imported into the game with box colliders layered over static images. This strategy birthed a host of issues, including the inconsistency of map sizes which led to a varying player's perspective - a discordant experience. Resolving this discrepancy became a priority in the game's revision.</p>
              <p>A creative shift towards a <span class="highlight">roguelike</span> game demanded <span class="highlight">randomly generated levels</span>. After successfully randomizing the backgrounds, the real challenge was implementing similar generation for the platforms. The platforms needed to maintain distance from each other to allow efficient navigation. This design loop aims to create a seamless experience for the player.</p>
              <p>Designing a platform system that met these requirements was a formidable, yet achievable task. After a few days and about 20 hours, I had a system that genuinely excited me as a developer.</p>
              <p>The rope, a relic from the original version where everything was baked into the map, was next for an overhaul. Despite earnest efforts, the rope remained a trouble spot, leading to a dip in motivation and a pause in development.</p>
              <p>Fast forward to the present. My reunion with the game was greeted by the unresolved <span class="highlight">rope issue</span>. After around 6-7 hours spent in an unsuccessful attempt to tame it, I took a break and decided to transition my project to <span class="highlight">GitHub</span> for better progress tracking. After a challenging transition from PlasticSCM on Unity to Git, I managed a successful migration.</p>
              <p>Looking forward, my goal is to prioritize tasks more effectively and consistently document my development process. Switching between development and research sparked some ideas:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>A desire to revamp the entire <span class="highlight">UI</span>, which is currently far from satisfying.</li>
                  <li>The potential inclusion of an <span class="highlight">inventory system</span>, and the cascade of decisions it would bring.</li>
                  <li>A goal to enhance <span class="highlight">player feedback</span>.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>June 16th, 2023</h2>
              <p>Today, I managed to allocate a few hours to improving the ladder mechanism. Some tweaking later, it's now functioning as intended. While I plan to refine it further, I'm pleased with the current state. The player can now bypass the rope until the up arrow key is pressed or held. They can also jump off or move up and down the rope, enhancing the sense of control during gameplay.</p>
              <p>In this game development journey, my primary focus has always been on ensuring a seamless player experience. The feeling of control is paramount - there are very few instances where I'd want the game to dictate the player's actions. That's why perfecting these <span class="highlight">ropes</span> is critical.</p>
              <p>Yesterday was dedicated to researching the game's UI/UX, a challenge that remains. The user interface should display key elements such as Health, Level, Experience bar, and Skills (possibly four). However, balancing information display and design aesthetics is a struggle.</p>
              <p>Currently, I'm eliminating elements from the previous UI that are no longer necessary. Although I'm more of a programmer than an artist, I draw inspiration from other games, noticing a trend towards minimalism in UI design. My aim is to strike a delicate balance between simplicity and functionality.</p>
              <p>Along with the UI, I'm contemplating the overall <span class="highlight">theme</span> of the game. Currently, the game lacks a uniform theme, resulting in a disjointed experience. Developing a coherent theme, I believe, will significantly enhance player immersion. </p>
              <p>On the programming side, the next big task is to ensure the projectiles feel coherent again. With the transition from Friendzoned to DuskRealm, I decided to blur class identification lines. The player's experience should be primarily determined by their choice of weapon, dictating the type of projectiles used. This means that monsters would need to drop these weapons, adding another layer of complexity.</p>
              <p>With these thoughts buzzing in my head, it's time to return to work and bring these ideas to life.</p>

              <h2>June 17th, 2023</h2>
              <p>Today was a notably productive day. The major accomplishment was sorting out the game's damage numbers. After some trial and error, I discovered a more efficient method to repeatedly create them. Now, I can produce a set in roughly 15 minutes, which is quite gratifying.</p>
              <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin: 20px 0;">

                      <img src="AllMonstersAndDamageSkins.PNG" alt="Image showcasing the different monster and damage skins" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 15px; box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23); margin-bottom: 15px;">

                  </figure>
              </div>

              <p>To make these numbers pop, I experimented with several techniques and color palettes. The standout was an orange-red gradient, which added a visually appealing touch to the game. I'll aim to include some pictures in the future to showcase this enhancement.</p>

              <p>The next task is to integrate these numbers with the damage calculation script. Once that's done, we'll be in business. I'm eager to finish, but to avoid burnout, I'll tackle this tomorrow. Today's 7 to 8 hours of dedicated work was quite productive.</p>

              <p>I'll admit, I need to develop better habits regarding commit messages. I tend to work on a majority of tasks and then commit everything at the last second, which isn't ideal. So, improving commit frequency and message quality is on my self-improvement list.</p>

              <p>Overall, I'm thrilled with today's progress and look forward to tomorrow's journey.</p>

              <h2>June 18th, 2023</h2>
              <p>Another productive day in the books. I started by ensuring the damage numbers function correctly. They now move upwards and fade out, creating a visually appealing stacking effect. This enables the player to see all inflicted damage simultaneously. Perfecting this feature took around three hours.</p>

              <p>Next, I elaborated on the projectile script to trigger the damage numbers. I also made a crucial decision to have the projectiles move towards the enemies when in range. This design choice creates a smoother playstyle, allowing the player to jump and launch their projectiles freely.</p>

              <p>I've also integrated more player feedback. When the player deals damage, the enemy flashes white. This enhancement significantly elevates the player's experience.</p>

              <p>Today was a significant milestone since the revision of the game. For the first time, I was able to run through the level, engage with mobs, and essentially play the game. With the mobs now susceptible to damage and death, the game is in a playable state. Seeing the gameplay come together is incredibly gratifying.</p>

              <p>Looking ahead, I'm eager to maintain this development momentum. Over the past couple of days, numerous small polishing changes have collectively transformed the game into something I'm genuinely proud of. Today, I dedicated roughly seven hours to development, and it certainly felt like the most result-driven day yet.</p>

              <p>I'm looking forward to the next few days. There are many minor details that, when combined, will tie the game together. I can't wait to return to work tomorrow and witness this transformation unfold.</p>

              <h2>June 19th, 2023</h2>
              <p>Another fruitful day, with the game increasingly taking shape. A significant development today was the addition of health bars. I chose to display the level text adjacent to the health bar. Also, when the enemy has taken no damage, the health bar is invisible, reducing screen clutter and enhancing the playing experience.</p>
              vbnet
              Copy code
              <p>We also tweaked the projectile a bit, as there were some tracking issues. We managed to rectify these and enabled visual indicators for when a bat is hit. I'm quite pleased with these advancements.</p>

              <p>Tomorrow, I plan to implement the stats page and leveling-up interface. I aim to enable players to eliminate mobs, level up, gain stats, and see these stats directly impact the player's damage output. Witnessing those numbers and feeling the progression in the game is something I'm eagerly anticipating.</p>

              <p>Another important task on my agenda is to work on our weapon system and figure out the implementation of various types of projectiles. I'm also on the hunt for better sound effects for the game. The previous sound pack I purchased didn't quite meet my expectations. While it had some decent sounds, I'm looking for that satisfying 'crunch', the jolt of dopamine a player gets when they hit an enemy or level up. Currently, the game's sound is more distracting than enhancing.</p>

              <p>That's it for today. Stay tuned for more updates tomorrow!</p>

              <h2>July 3rd, 2023</h2>
              <p>Hello again! It's been almost two weeks since the last update. Daily blogs started becoming a bit of a balancing act, and I decided it would be best to focus on the game and only update the blog for more significant milestones. A lot has changed since the last entry, and I felt it necessary to share some insights on the major design changes that are taking place.</p>

              <p>Last night, after playing MapleStory for the first time in a while, I was struck by several features they had executed brilliantly in the genre. While I don't plan to detail all the notes from this gaming session, it highlighted a need to rework DuskRealm's combat system. In its current state, it lacks the satisfaction that a player should experience. The initial design, heavily influenced by the class design in early MapleStory, now seems outdated, less flashy, and less satisfying.</p>

              <p>Given this, the idea of fluid characters might be replaced with more static characters with possible skill trees. The skills currently in the game don't quite hit the mark. To enhance the player experience, there's a need for larger AOE, larger hitboxes, and a real sense of power. Mobility is another factor to consider. To facilitate player autonomy, I believe attaching skills to the weapon, rather than the class, may not be the best idea. The goal is to encapsulate the entire experience of playing a game like MapleStory into 20 to 30-minute sessions.</p>

              <p>In light of these insights, I've identified a few areas where DuskRealm could improve. For instance, the entire rope system may need to be discarded. Instead, providing the character with an upwards movement skill could improve gameplay. I'm also reconsidering the level design. Currently, the platforms are spawning in a circular rotation, although okay, aren't ideal. Some of the most desirable maps are single-platform or feature multiple platforms in a linear direction. This design allows players to hit more than one platform at once, enhancing the player experience.</p>

              <p>However, I also want to maintain some variety in map designs. Not every map should enable the player to hit everything with one skill. I'm aiming for a diversity of levels that spark different levels of excitement when the player loads into a new one.</p>

              <p>Lastly, the art in the game could use some improvement. Thankfully, I've recently connected with an artist, and I'm hopeful this aspect of the game will soon see some significant changes.</p>

              <p>Stay tuned for the next update and thank you for being a part of this journey!</p>
