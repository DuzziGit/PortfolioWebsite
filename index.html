            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi there! I'm Dante Lenarduzzi, and I'd like to extend a warm welcome to my portfolio. I'm thrilled you've chosen to spend a bit of your time exploring my work, so thank you for being here.</p>
            <p>I'll kick off with a little bit about myself. My lifelong love for video games has seen me consistently rank within the top 1% of players in several competitive games. I now aim to channel this passion and determination into a career in game development. I'm all about making a meaningful contribution to the industry, eagerly seeking opportunities to be part of something larger than myself.</p>
            <p>My educational journey took me to St. Clair College, where I earned an advanced diploma in mobile app development. This has equipped me with a solid understanding of languages like <span class="highlight">C#, C++, Swift, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL</span>. I've also delved into <span class="highlight">agile and scrum methodologies</span>, giving me a holistic perspective on project management. Additionally, I've independently immersed myself in the world of Version Control tools, mastering <span class="highlight">Git Bash, Github Desktop, and Plastic SCM</span>.</p>
            <p>Communication and leadership are two of my strong suits, complimenting my steadfast work ethic. My experience in competitive gaming has allowed me to collaborate with diverse teams in varied environments, honing my skills in effective communication and leadership. While I flourish in a team setting, I'm also able to work independently, relentlessly striving to achieve the task at hand.</p>

                <h3>Game Development Projects</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">My expertise lies in Unity</span>, the game engine that I've chosen for my projects. I first used Unity to develop the capstone project for my college. This development took place over 8 months, a challenging and enlightening journey that laid the foundation for my future endeavors.
</p>
                <p>
                    The capstone project, initially titled "FriendZoned," was a group effort. However, as we finished the project, I felt that it didn't fully satisfy my creative needs or meet my high expectations. It was our first game, and while it served as a valuable learning experience, I felt I had more to offer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Therefore, at the beginning of June this year, I embarked on a personal project, a game called "DuskRealm". Using the knowledge I had gained from working on "FriendZoned," I began transforming the original idea into a more unique concept. This time, I had full creative freedom and a clear vision for the game.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "DuskRealm" serves as not only a creative outlet but also a means to familiarize myself with all aspects of game development. Except for the art, I have single-handedly managed the designing, developing, documentation, and testing. This journey has taught me an enormous amount in a relatively short period of time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My journey in game development continues, with a constant thirst for learning and honing my skills. I plan to develop games independently until I eventually become part of a team where I can translate these skills into aiding the growth of a project bigger than myself. The journey thus far has been thrilling, and I am excited to see where it leads.
