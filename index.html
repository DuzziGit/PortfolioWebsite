            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi there! I'm Dante Lenarduzzi, and I'd like to extend a warm welcome to my portfolio. I'm thrilled you've chosen to spend a bit of your time exploring my work, so thank you for being here.</p>
            <p>I'll kick off with a little bit about myself. My lifelong love for video games has seen me consistently rank within the top 1% of players in several competitive games. I now aim to channel this passion and determination into a career in game development. I'm all about making a meaningful contribution to the industry, eagerly seeking opportunities to be part of something larger than myself.</p>
            <p>My educational journey took me to St. Clair College, where I earned an advanced diploma in mobile app development. This has equipped me with a solid understanding of languages like <span class="highlight">C#, C++, Swift, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL</span>. I've also delved into <span class="highlight">agile and scrum methodologies</span>, giving me a holistic perspective on project management. Additionally, I've independently immersed myself in the world of Version Control tools, mastering <span class="highlight">Git Bash, Github Desktop, and Plastic SCM</span>.</p>
            <p>Communication and leadership are two of my strong suits, complimenting my steadfast work ethic. My experience in competitive gaming has allowed me to collaborate with diverse teams in varied environments, honing my skills in effective communication and leadership. While I flourish in a team setting, I'm also able to work independently, relentlessly striving to achieve the task at hand.</p>

                <h3>Game Development Projects</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">My expertise lies in Unity</span>, the game engine I've chosen for my projects. My journey with Unity began when I developed my college capstone project, an experience that was both challenging and enlightening, laying the groundwork for my future endeavors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our capstone project, initially named "FriendZoned," was a collaborative effort. However, upon its completion, I realized that it didn't quite fulfill my creative needs or meet my high expectations. Though it served as a valuable learning experience, I believed I had more to offer.
                </p>
                <p>
                   in June, I embarked on a personal project named "DuskRealm." Using the knowledge I had amassed from "FriendZoned," I transformed the original idea into a more unique concept. This time, I had the liberty to exercise my creative freedom, and a clear vision for the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "DuskRealm" is more than a creative outlet—it's also a learning tool, allowing me to familiarize myself with all facets of game development. Except for the art, I single-handedly handled the design, development, documentation, and testing, learning a tremendous amount in a relatively short span.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My journey in game development continues, fueled by a constant desire for learning and refining my skills. I aim to develop games independently until I eventually join a team where I can apply these skills to contribute to a project larger than myself. The journey thus far has been thrilling, and I'm eager to see where it leads.

                    <h4>FriendZoned</h4>
                    <p>
                        "FriendZoned" was our capstone project developed during my college years. It was a valuable learning experience, but I felt there was more I could offer. It didn't fully satisfy my creative needs or meet my high expectations. Despite that, it laid a strong foundation for my future endeavors in game development.

                    <p>
                        "DuskRealm" is my personal project, born out of the desire to create a game that truly resonated with my creative vision. It was a leap from the learnings of "FriendZoned", transformed into a unique concept. The process, though challenging, helped me master various facets of game development.
